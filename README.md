# Recommendation-System


- A recommendation system is a type of software that suggests items to users based on their preferences, past behavior, and other relevant data.

# Topics Covered

The topics that will be covered or included in this repository:

- Case 1: it recommendes on the basis of popularity, for the customers that are new and we have no data about them. 

- Case 2 : Cluster based recommendation system 

- Case 3 : Collaborative filtering

- Case 4 : Frequently bought together (No ML): It suggests items that customers purchase in bulk.The tactic I employed in this case was to filter out products with the same ID and the date those items were, of course, purchased simultaneously. I then developed a frequency table to recommend the top items that were purchased concurrently.

- Market Basket analysis: uses apriori algorithm for recommendation.
