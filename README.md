# Topics Covered

The topics that will be covered or included in this repository:

- Case 1: it recommendes on the basis of popularity, for the customers that are new and we have no data about them. 

- Case 2 : Cluster based recommendation system 

- Case 3 : Collaborative filtering

- Case 4 : Frequently bought together (No ML): It recommends those which are bought together by customers.The strategy I used here is that I filtered out items having same ID and day the item having same ID, ofcourse are bought together and then I've created a frequency table to suggest top items that are bought together.
